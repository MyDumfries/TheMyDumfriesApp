A list of Tweets by Tweeters selected for their Dumfries Links. Some, like ITV Border and BBC South of Scotland, cover a wider area than Dumfries, but as many of their Tweets will be relative, they have been included.

If there is anyone missing from the list who you think should be included, please email me at stuart@mydumfries.com.

You can click on links within the Tweets, and also by Long Clicking on a Tweet, you will have the option to 
1. Refresh Tweets (load Tweets posted since you last downloaded)
2. Reload Previous Tweets (the Tweets from your last session)
3. Reload last 100 Tweets
4. Post a Status Update of your own, either over Wifi or via SMS Text Message (your mobile phone company may charge for this)
5. Retweet the post by either Wifi or SMS.
