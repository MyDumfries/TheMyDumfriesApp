A list of people who have registered on MyDumfries. You can long click on a name to contact them by e-mail, Facebook or Twitter (if they have provided these details).

You can click on "Add Me!" to add your details to the list.  I've decided that all you really need is your name, year of Birth, e-mail address, Facebook and Twitter links (all optional!) as it will then be possible to go to your Facebook or Twitter profile to find out more, but if you'd really like to, you can provide more details at MyDumfries.com.

As there aren't many registered people at the moment I haven't provided an option to download the database to your device, so you will need an internet connection, but if the list starts to grow I will look at adding this as an option.
